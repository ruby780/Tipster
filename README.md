## Notes

Since this was the first ios app I implemented it was overall a challenging but enriching experience. The base version of the tip calculator was easy to implement but the challenging part was implementing the new UI and the animations. I found most challenging figuring out how to implement the animations since I had no experience with them, but after watching many tutorials on Youtube it was easier to visualize the implementation. Another challenging aspect was visualizing what pieces of the UI to tie in with the code swift code in order for the implementation to be correct.
